# CSE 703 Seminar: Deep Learning for Visual Recognition with Applications to Medical Imaging Analysis

## Description:
Deep learning is providing exciting solutions for visual recognition problems and is seen as a key method for future applications. This course is a deep dive into the state-of-the-art algorithms in the CNN architectures, image classification, object detection and segmentation. Medical imaging analysis, as a unique application of computer vision to provide computer-aided analysis, will also be covered. The course will be beneficial to students interested in understanding the massive amount of literature in computer vision and deep learning.

## Papers I summarized and presented:
1. [Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)
2. [Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852)
